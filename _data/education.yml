    During my time at IIUI I learnt most of my key skills that have I have taken through my career such as teamwork and working to tight deadlines. I thouroughly enjoyed my time as university and learnt a lot about a healthy work life balance.

    I spent a lot of my free time as a volunteer social worker and arrange blood donation camps during summer holidays.
